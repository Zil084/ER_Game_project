Role-playing games (RPGs) have traditionally dominated the Japanese market, whereas North American (NA) and European (EU) markets demonstrate a preference for Shooter games. Our analysis, conducted using Excel, indicates a current opportunity for ER Game to target the Japanese audience with RPGs. However, looking ahead, diversifying game genres, especially by incorporating shooters, will be beneficial for capturing the NA and EU markets. It's noteworthy that games rated "M" (for mature adults) are popular across all three regions. Thus, ER Game's future endeavors should not only focus on the RPG genre but also incorporate elements appealing to mature audiences. While Bethesda Softworks is a significant contender in NA and EU, in Japan, Capcom is the primary competitor. The silver lining is that Capcom hasn't monopolized sales in Japan, presenting ER Game with an entry opportunity into the market.
